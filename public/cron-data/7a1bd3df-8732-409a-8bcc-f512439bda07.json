Real AI for trading means backtesting with historical data \u2192 stratify-black.vercel.app #algotrading\")\n3. **Housing data reply (2\u2665):** Could have added Stratify/Discord mention on macro strategy building\n\n---\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n- **Script runtime:** ~90 seconds (normal)\n- **API status:** Twitter OAuth 1.0a working, Anthropic API generating excellent content\n- **Search quality:** Good (found 33\u2665 conversation)\n- **Content generation:** EXCELLENT (sharp voice, contrarian takes, zero generic replies)\n- **Promotion logic:** **COMPLETELY BROKEN** (zero Discord/Stratify mentions for 10 consecutive runs)\n\n---\n\n## CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED\n\n\ud83d\udea8 **IMMEDIATE SCRIPT INTERVENTION NEEDED BEFORE NEXT RUN (6:00 PM)**\n\n### Problem\n`x-engagement.py` Anthropic API prompts **DO NOT include Discord/Stratify promotion logic**. Script is generating excellent content but completely ignoring promotion requirements from SOUL.md and cron instructions.\n\n### Solution (BEFORE 6:00 PM RUN)\n1. Open `~/.openclaw/workspace/x-engagement.py`\n2. Review Anthropic API prompt construction (system/user prompts)\n3. Add EXPLICIT promotion requirements:\n   - \"Include Discord link (discord.gg/6RPsREggYV) naturally in 1 out of 3 tweets\"\n   - \"Mention Stratify (stratify-black.vercel.app) when discussing backtesting/strategy building\"\n   - \"Original tweets should end with 3-5 hashtags\"\n   - \"Use self-reply tactic: post original tweet, then reply to own tweet with Discord link\"\n4. Add hardcoded promotion triggers for keywords: \"algo\", \"trading\", \"strategy\", \"backtest\", \"crypto\", \"AI\"\n5. Implement forced Strategy Spotlight format for at least 1 original tweet per day\n\n### Next Run (6:00 PM) MUST Include:\n- **Original tweet:** Strategy Spotlight (Momentum or RSI Bounce template + backtest data + Stratify link + 3-5 hashtags)\n- **Self-reply:** Within 2 minutes, reply to own tweet with Discord link (\"Join our trading Discord for more strategies like this \u2192 discord.gg/6RPsREggYV\")\n- **External replies:** At least 2 replies with natural Discord/Stratify mentions (search \"how to backtest\", \"algo trading\", \"trading strategy help\")\n- **Target:** 15-20 total engagements\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Content Quality:** 10/10 \u2014 Voice is razor-sharp, topics are relevant, engagement targets are good\n**Promotion Execution:** 0/10 \u2014 Zero community building for 24 consecutive hours\n**Growth Result:** 0 followers gained in 24 hours despite excellent content\n\n**We're creating screenshot-worthy content with perfect brand voice but giving people NOWHERE TO GO and NO REASON TO FOLLOW.**\n\nWithout immediate script intervention, follower growth will remain permanently stalled regardless of content quality.\n\n---\n\n**Time:** 4:00 PM ET | **Next Run:** 6:00 PM ET | **Urgency:** \ud83d\udea8 ABSOLUTE EMERGENCY",
