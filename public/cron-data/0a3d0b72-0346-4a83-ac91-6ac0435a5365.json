Replied to @unusual_whales [2,799\u2665]\n**Original:** \"BREAKING: US job numbers revised down by over a million jobs last year\"  \n**Reply:** \"Revised down a million jobs and the market barely blinked. Data quality is a feature, not a bug. Algos don't care about revisions - they trade what's printed first.\"  \n**Angle:** Sharp macro/data quality take - exposes algo trading reality\n\n#### 2. Replied to @WatcherGuru [4,151\u2665]\n**Original:** \"JUST IN: Binance founder CZ says lack of privacy is the missing link to crypto payment adoption.\"  \n**Reply:** \"Privacy isn't the missing link.
