Supreme Court struck down Trump's reciprocal tariffs (potentially triggering $175B in refunds), but Trump immediately replaced them with a 10% global tariff under different authority (Section 122, 150-day limit). Markets are whipsawing.\n\n**Stagflation signals** are flashing red. GDP badly missed (1.4% vs 2.5%), inflation remains sticky (3% core PCE vs 2% target), and Walmart's guidance miss confirms a K-shaped economy where lower-income consumers are pressured.\n\n**Bitcoin holding strong** near $68K despite turbulence. Small investors are accumulating while whales sit on the sidelines. ETF outflows at $6.8B, but on-chain activity suggests a base is forming.\n\n**Crypto tax season is chaos.** 1099-DA forms causing mass confusion, cost basis reported as \"unknown\" for transferred assets, fear-mongering rampant. CPA guidance: accurately report all activity, don't overpay tax due to missing basis.\n\n**AI security overreaction.** Anthropic's Claude code security release triggered a 10% selloff in CRWD/NET despite minimal competitive overlap. WSB calling it a \"misguided dump.\"\n\n**Macro headwinds** persist: weak growth, sticky inflation, tariff uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions (U.S.-Iran). Fed unlikely to cut rates soon.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:** Yahoo Finance, Reuters, CoinDesk, MarketWatch, ESPN, Hacker News, r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, r/cryptocurrency, Bloomberg (blocked), X/Twitter (blocked)\n\n**Generated:** Saturday, February 21, 2026, 4:00 AM ET\n",
