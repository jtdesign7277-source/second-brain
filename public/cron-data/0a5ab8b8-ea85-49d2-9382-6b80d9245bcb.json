  "content": "### Feb 16, 2026 @ 8:07 PM\n- **Posted:** 1 original tweet about Monday after-hours psychology (sharp contrast: winners reviewing execution vs. losers planning revenge trades + naturally mentioned Stratify beta users backtesting both scenarios + 4 hashtags: #trading #algotrading #stockmarket #buildinpublic)\n- **Liked:** 3 high-engagement posts (@TrendSpider $AMZN chart [63 likes], @TrendSpider Forbes $BTC [175 likes], @WatcherGuru Meta AI patent [877 likes])\n- **Replied to @TrendSpider** (2 sharp replies):\n  - $AMZN dot-com trendline (63 likes, reply ID: 2023565055585816708): \"Trendlines from 20 years ago. Bold. Most traders would've pivoted when AWS became 80% of the story. That's the difference between historical patterns and current fundamentals. Chart says one thing. Balance sheet says another.\"\n  - Forbes $BTC cover (175 likes, reply ID: 2023565057016176922): \"Forbes covers are historically contrarian indicators. Peak magazine cover = peak sentiment. Bitcoin doesn't care about Forbes. It cares about supply dynamics and institutional allocation. Sentiment is noise. Math is signal.\"\n- **Result:** All actions successful (post/likes/replies all worked - API tier issues resolved!)\n- **Followers:** 25 (down 10 from recent 35 - significant drop, possibly Twitter bot purge or natural churn)\n- **Quality:** Excellent - perfect Monday 8:07 PM timing (after hours, traders processing the day), original tweet naturally integrated beta messaging (beta users backtesting vs. emotional revenge trading), both replies brought sharp contrarian insight (@TrendSpider is major TA platform - 63 and 175 like conversations), zero generic engagement, memorable hooks (\"Sentiment is noise. Math is signal\"), voice stayed consistent\n- **Theme:** After-hours discipline + beta value prop (Stratify users learn from data, others repeat emotional patterns)\n- **Timing:** After Hours Take slot (8:07 PM ET) - perfect post-market reflection window\n- **Beta Messaging:** \u2705 Successfully integrated beta status naturally (\"Stratify beta users? They're backtesting both scenarios with real data\")\n- **Win:** Successfully engaged with @TrendSpider twice (63 and 175 likes) - major technical analysis platform; all API calls worked (post/search/like/reply fully operational)\n- **Technical:** API tier restrictions RESOLVED - search/like/reply all working now; all actions successful via x-api-helper.py (Python + OAuth 1.0a)\n- **Concern:** Follower drop from 35 \u2192 25 in past few hours; monitor for pattern vs. one-time purge\n- **Second Brain:** Local save + API backup both completed\n",
