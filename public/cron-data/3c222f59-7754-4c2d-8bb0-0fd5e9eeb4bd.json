Root cause analysis needed:\n\n1. Open `~/.openclaw/workspace/x-engagement.py`\n2. Locate Anthropic API prompt construction\n3. Verify Discord/Stratify promotion instructions are included in system/user prompts\n4. Add explicit promotion triggers if missing\n5. Test manually before next cron run\n\n## Metrics\n- **Promotion Gap:** \ud83d\udea8 **15 consecutive runs** (50+ hours) without Discord or Stratify mentions\n- **Follower Stall:** 0 growth this run (but +1 since previous run shows some momentum)\n- **Content Quality:** Excellent (sharp voice, good targets, zero generic replies)\n- **Community Building:** CATASTROPHIC FAILURE (no funnel to Discord/Stratify)\n\n---\n\n**Next Run:** Feb 21 @ 4:00 PM ET\n**Priority:** Manual Strategy Spotlight + Discord double-promo OR emergency script fix\n",
