Manual promotion content from Feb 21 @ 8:00 PM (Strategy Spotlight + Discord self-reply) may have driven delayed growth\n2. Consistent content quality finally breaking through\n3. High-engagement reply to 54\u2665 Bull Run prediction tweet gained visibility\n4. Need 24-48 more hours to determine if this is sustained growth or one-off\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Monitor next 4-6 runs to confirm growth trend\n- If growth continues, attribute to Feb 21 manual promotion efforts\n- If growth stalls again, confirms script promotion failure as root cause\n\n---\n\n## Promotion Gap Alert\n\ud83d\udea8 **CRITICAL \u2014 VERIFICATION REQUIRED** \u2014 Cannot confirm Discord/Stratify promotion due to truncated output. Script has failed 18 consecutive runs (58+ hours) to include promotion. Manual Twitter verification required:\n\n1. Check @StratifyAI timeline for full Fed inflation tweet text\n2. Look for Discord link (discord.gg/6RPsREggYV) in any content\n3. Look for Stratify link (stratify-black.vercel.app) in any content\n4. Verify hashtags on original tweet (#algotrading #buildinpublic + 1-3 others)\n\nIf NO promotion found in this run, this marks **19th consecutive script failure (60 hours)**.\n\n---\n\n## Next Run Recommendations (12:00 PM)\n**Strategy:** Midday aggressive engagement push\n\n1. **Original Tweet:** Strategy Spotlight (Momentum or RSI Bounce template) with real backtest data + Stratify link + 5 hashtags\n2. **Self-Reply:** Discord promotion within 2 minutes (\"We analyze strategies like this daily in our Discord. Real traders, real setups, zero hype \u2192 discord.gg/6RPsREggYV\")\n3. **External Replies:** 6-8 replies targeting:\n   - \"How to backtest\" / \"algo trading beginner\" searches\n   - Trending $SPY / $QQQ / $TSLA conversations\n   - At least 2 replies must include natural Discord/Stratify mentions\n4. **Likes:** 5-8 quality posts (reduce from 14 to focus on replies)\n5. **Target:** 18-22 total engagements\n\n**Timing:** 12:00 PM ET = Midday market action, high FinTwit activity\n\n---\n\n## Technical Notes\n- **Runtime:** ~90 seconds (normal)\n- **Twitter API:** Fully operational (OAuth 1.0a working)\n- **Script Status:** Executed without errors\n- **Output:** Partially truncated (full tweet text not visible in logs)\n- **Anthropic API:** Generating content but promotion status unverified\n\n---\n\n## Action Items\n- [ ] Manually verify promotion content on @StratifyAI Twitter timeline\n- [ ] Confirm hashtag usage on original Fed inflation tweet\n- [ ] Monitor follower count at 12:00 PM run to confirm growth trend\n- [ ] If no promotion found, schedule Monday script diagnostic (open x-engagement.py, review Anthropic prompt construction, add explicit Discord/Stratify requirements)\n\n---\n\n**Bottom Line:** Strong execution (19 engagements, +1 follower), but promotion verification critical. If this run also lacked Discord/Stratify mentions despite good content, script must be manually fixed before Monday market open.\n",
