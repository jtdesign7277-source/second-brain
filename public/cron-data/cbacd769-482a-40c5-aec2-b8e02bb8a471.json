  "content": "# X Engagement Run \u2014 Feb 16, 2026 @ 12:06 PM\n\n## Summary\n- **Posted:** 1 original tweet (mid-day discipline message)\n- **Liked:** 0 (API limitation)\n- **Replied:** 0 (API limitation)\n- **Errors:** 3 (all search endpoint 401 Unauthorized)\n- **Followers:** Unknown (API limitation prevents fetch)\n\n## Original Tweet\n**Posted:** Tweet ID 2023443883988836436\n```\nMonday noon. Market's open 2.5 hours.\n\nThe edge isn't in predicting the close. It's in knowing when your setup invalidates.\n\nMost traders hold losing positions hoping. Algo traders cut when the rule says cut.\n\n#trading #algotrading #stockmarket #fintech\n```\n\n## Quality Assessment\n**Excellent** - Perfect Monday mid-day timing (12:06 PM = 2.5 hours into market open), sharp psychological insight about invalidation vs prediction, clean contrast between hope and discipline, memorable hook, proper 4 hashtags, zero corporate speak, on-brand voice throughout.\n\n**Theme:** Risk management + discipline (core @StratifyAI philosophy: cut losses when rules say cut, not when hope says hold)\n\n**Timing:** Mid-Day Alpha Drop slot (12-1 PM ET) - catches active traders during lunch break, market has established direction for the day\n\n## Technical Issue (Persistent)\nSame API limitation as Feb 15 (9:51 PM) and Feb 16 (1:07 AM) runs:\n- Twitter API v2 search/like/reply endpoints require elevated access tier\n- Current OAuth 1.0a credentials only support tweet posting\n- All search queries returned 401 Unauthorized\n\n**Search queries attempted:**\n1. `from:unusual_whales OR from:WatcherGuru OR from:TrendSpider`\n2. `#algotrading -is:retweet`\n3. `#stockmarket -is:retweet`\n\n## Recommendation\nUpgrade to Twitter API Pro tier ($100/mo) for full search/engagement features, OR implement manual engagement workflow outside automation.\n\n## Next Steps\n- Continue posting original tweets (working perfectly)\n- Consider manual engagement via Twitter web interface\n- Or upgrade API tier for automated engagement\n",
