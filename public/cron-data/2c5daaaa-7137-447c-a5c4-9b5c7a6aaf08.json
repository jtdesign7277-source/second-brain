Reply to @unusual_whales (440\u2665 Buffett portfolio tweet)\n**Tweet ID:** 2023883723024867418  \n**Text:**\n> Everyone watches what Buffett buys. Nobody watches what he sells.\n> \n> The real alpha is in the exits. Berkshire's 13F deletions tell you more about overvaluation than any talking head on CNBC.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Contrarian insight: exits > entries for smart money analysis\n- Targets common retail behavior (obsessing over buys, ignoring sells)\n- Sharp jab at financial media (\"talking head on CNBC\")\n- Actionable takeaway: 13F deletions = overvaluation signal\n- On-brand @StratifyAI voice throughout\n\n---\n\n### 2.
