Today, it's worth $155.\"\n\n**Reply:** \"From $635K to $155. That's not a correction, that's a reminder: if you can't backtest it, it's not an investment. It's a bet on hype.\"\n\n**Analysis:** Sharp contrarian take connecting NFT speculation to trading discipline. Core @StratifyAI philosophy: backtest or it's not a strategy.\n\n#### Reply 2: @unusual_whales (10,123 likes) \u2014 Job Data Revisions\n**Original:** \"BREAKING: US job numbers revised down by over a million jobs last year\"\n\n**Reply:** \"Revisions this big don't just tweak models \u2014 they break them.
