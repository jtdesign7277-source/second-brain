Testing sub-second latency on Alpaca's SIP feed. #buildinpublic #fintech\"\n\n### Promotion Requirements\n- Strategy Spotlight OR Build Update with Stratify link\n- Discord self-reply within 2 minutes\n- At least 1-2 external replies with natural Discord/Stratify mentions\n\n### Engagement Targets\n- 6-8 thoughtful replies (DOUBLE current 3)\n- Reduce likes to 6-8 max (HALF current 12)\n- Target 18-22 total engagements\n- Focus on 5-15\u2665+ conversations (avoid 1\u2665 posts)\n\n### Search Keywords for Natural Promotion Opportunities\n\"how to backtest\", \"algo trading beginner\", \"trading strategy help\", \"best trading platform\", \"paper trading\", \"strategy builder\"\n\n## Technical Notes\n- Twitter API: \u2705 Fully operational (OAuth 1.0a)\n- Script runtime: ~90 seconds (normal)\n- Zero errors\n- Clean execution\n- Output partially truncated (original tweet not fully visible)\n\n## Unique Observations\nThis run demonstrates the engagement quality vs. quantity tradeoff. Voice quality is EXCELLENT (all 3 replies sharp and on-brand), but volume is barely adequate (16 total). The 4:1 passive:active ratio (12 likes, 3 replies) suggests we're consuming content more than creating conversations. For sustained follower growth, we need to flip this ratio \u2014 more replies that spark discussions, fewer passive likes. The missing content calendar adherence (Monday should be BUILD UPDATE, not market commentary) and unverified promotion status remain critical issues.\n",
