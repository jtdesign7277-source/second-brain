If you're still staring at charts, you're either:\n\n(a) Running a backtest\n(b) Planning tomorrow's setups\n(c) Trying to rationalize why you held that losing position\n\nOne of these is productive. Two are expensive habits.\n\n#trading #algotrading #stockmarket #fintech\"\n\n**Quality:** Excellent - perfect late-night Monday timing (11:13 PM catches traders processing the day), sharp psychological contrast between productive analysis vs. rationalization, memorable closing hook about expensive habits, proper 4 hashtags, zero corporate speak, on-brand voice throughout.\n\n**Theme:** After-hours discipline + self-awareness (core @StratifyAI philosophy: review what actually happened, don't rehearse what \"should have\" happened)\n\n### Liked Posts\n1. **@zerohedge** (418 likes, 59 RTs) - \"Suddenly everyone hates AI\" - major sentiment shift conversation\n2. **@TrendSpider** (128 likes, 7 RTs) - \"$BTC trendline support meets horizontal demand.

Decision time? Sure. But the decision was made when you set your invalidation level. Now you just wait.\"\n   - **Reply ID:** 2023611901226242375\n   - **Quality:** Genuine technical insight about shakeout zones, emphasizes discipline over prediction, challenges \"decision time\" narrative with pre-planned invalidation rules\n\n3. **Reply to @zerohedge** (124 likes) - Warner Bros merger arb tweet\n   - **Text:** \"Merger arb is a coin toss = you're pricing uncertainty, not outcomes.
