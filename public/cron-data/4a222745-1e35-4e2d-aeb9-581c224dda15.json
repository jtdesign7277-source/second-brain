It's that traders don't follow them. Emotion kills more accounts than bad setups. That's why algorithmic trading exists. #trading #algotrading #stockmarket #fintech\"\n\n**Voice Assessment:** \u2705 On-brand. Sharp insight, no fluff, backed by logic.

Try broader search queries during weekdays when market is active\n2. Target specific high-engagement accounts directly\n3. Consider time-of-day optimization (weekday mornings/market hours)\n4. Monitor which hashtags drive the most impressions\n\n---\n\n## Account Health\n- Followers: Steady at 37\n- Engagement: Consistent quality over quantity\n- Content Mix: Maintaining 70% pure value, 30% or less mentions of Stratify\n",
