NO DISCORD PROMOTION \u274c\n**Problem:** Zero mentions of Discord (https://discord.gg/6RPsREggYV) in this run.\n**Impact:** Missing community growth opportunity.\n**Required:** 1 in every 3-4 tweets must mention Discord naturally.\n**Gap:** Last Discord promo was Feb 19 @ 8:00 AM (2 runs ago). Currently at 2-run gap. OVERDUE for next run.\n\n### 2. NO STRATIFY SITE PROMOTION \u274c\n**Problem:** Zero mentions of https://stratify-black.vercel.app.\n**Impact:** Missing product awareness + beta funnel opportunity.\n**Required:** Natural mentions in strategy/beta/product tweets.\n**Gap:** Last Stratify promo was Feb 19 @ 8:00 AM (2 runs ago). OVERDUE for next run.\n\n### 3. LOW ENGAGEMENT VOLUME \u26a0\ufe0f\n**Target:** 10-15 engagements per run (original tweets + replies + quote tweets).\n**Delivered:** 4 content pieces (1 tweet + 3 replies) + 7 likes = 11 total actions.\n**Issue:** Meeting bare minimum. Should push for MORE replies (5-8 per run) to maximize visibility.\n\n### 4. NO HASHTAGS VISIBLE \u26a0\ufe0f\n**Problem:** Original Tesla tweet excerpt doesn't show hashtags (may be truncated in output).\n**Required:** EVERY original tweet must end with 3-5 hashtags (#trading #algotrading #stockmarket #fintech #buildinpublic).\n**Action:** Verify on Twitter that hashtags were included. If not, script needs fix.\n\n## What Worked\n\u2705 **Sharp contrarian voice** \u2014 all 3 replies delivered real insight, no generic engagement\n\u2705 **Diverse topic coverage** \u2014 traditional finance ($HIMS telemedicine) + crypto (BTC/LTC/Open Interest)\n\u2705 **Dry humor execution** \u2014 \"That's cute\" = perfect @StratifyAI deadpan\n\u2705 **Educational value** \u2014 valuation metrics (6x revenue), correlation breakdown insights\n\u2705 **Mid-morning timing** \u2014 10:00 AM ET = active market hours, good visibility window\n\u2705 **Zero errors** \u2014 Twitter OAuth + Anthropic API both operational\n\n## What Needs Improvement\n\u274c **MUST include Discord link** \u2014 hit 2-run gap, OVERDUE for community promo\n\u274c **MUST include Stratify mention** \u2014 beta/product awareness gap\n\u274c **Push for MORE replies** \u2014 target 5-8 per run (only hit 3)\n\u274c **Consider quote tweets** \u2014 underutilized engagement format\n\u274c **Follower growth stalled** \u2014 32 steady for 3 runs straight (since 8:00 AM)\n\n## Next Run Recommendations\n\n### Timing: 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM ET (Mid-Day Alpha slot)\n**Why:** Peak FinTwit activity during lunch hour, high engagement opportunity.\n\n### Content Focus:\n1. **Original Tweet:** Strategy Spotlight (RSI Bounce or MACD Crossover) with BACKTEST DATA + Stratify mention\n   - Example: \"Built an RSI Bounce strategy on Stratify. 2-year backtest: 67% win rate, 34% annual return.
