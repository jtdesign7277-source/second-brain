## What We Built

### 4 OpenClaw Agents Running
1. **Fred** (main) — Opus 4 — Brain, planning, building, everything
2. **Codex** — OpenAI o3 — Vibe coding agent, runs Codex CLI against repos
3. **StratifyAI** (xbot) — Sonnet 4.5 — Dedicated X/Twitter engagement bot
4. **TradeBot** (trader) — Sonnet 4.5 — Automated paper trading execution

### TradeBot — Automated Paper Trading System
- **Agent:** `trader` with full workspace at `~/.openclaw/workspace-trader/`
- **Cron:** Runs every 5 min, Mon-Fri 9:00 AM - 3:55 PM ET
- **How it works:**
  - User chats with Fred → generates a trading strategy
  - Saves strategy to Strategies section in Second Brain sidebar
  - Clicks strategy → Strategy Activation Panel appears
  - Settings: Symbol, Position Size ($10K default), Stop Loss %, Take Profit %, Max Daily Trades
  - 6-checkbox Pre-Trade Checklist (all must be green):
    1. Entry Signal Confirmed
    2. Volume Above Average
    3. Trend Alignment
    4. Risk/Reward ≥ 2:1
    5. Stop Loss Defined
    6. Position Size OK
  - User clicks **Activate Strategy** → TradeBot starts monitoring
  - **Kill switch** (red Stop Strategy button) halts it instantly
- **Multi-user:** Server-side API at `/api/strategies` — each user gets $200K paper balance
- **Market data:** Alpaca live API keys for real quotes/bars
- **Paper trades only** — never places real orders, tracks in own ledger
- **Alpaca keys configured:** Added to Vercel env vars + ~/.zshrc + TradeBot workspace

### X Bot Agent (StratifyAI)
- Migrated X engagement cron from main agent → dedicated xbot agent

## Known Issues (Carried Forward)
1. Stratify sign-in broken — `/api/auth` returning 404

3. X handle still @Stratify_hq, needs manual rename to @StratifyAI
4. Second Brain codebase in GitHub but was built via Vercel editor originally
