# **📝 Daily Summary — Sunday, February 15, 2026**

## What We Built

### HeyGen Promo Video & LiveAvatar Chat Widget
- Created 37-second "Stratify: The Future of Trading" promo video via HeyGen Video Agent (male avatar, dark fintech aesthetic, 8 scenes)
- Added "Meet Stratify" video section on landing page between hero and feature cards
- Built **LiveAvatarChat.jsx** — floating interactive chat widget with Katya avatar (Black Suit)
- Built `/api/liveavatar-token.js` serverless function for session/LiveKit management
- Features: person icon trigger, spring animation open, live captions as Katya talks
- LiveAvatar Essential plan ($99/mo, 1k credits)

### Pre-Trade Checklist & Key Trade Setups
- **Pre-Trade Checklist** — 6 items extracted from Fred's strategy output, green glow, editable summary card, flows into Strategy Activation
- **Key Trade Setups card** — 5 setups from Fred always displayed on top of right panel, 6th ($ Allocation) is user-editable
- "Ask Fred to Retest" button added

### Second Brain — API Key System
- Built full API key system: Supabase tables, key generation, validation, rate limiting, usage tracking
- Metered `/api/chat` endpoint behind API keys
- Inline name input for new documents (type + Enter)

### Stratify — Per-User Broker Connections
- Alpaca + Webull support with encrypted key storage and connect flow
- Wired real Alpaca positions + account data to Portfolio page

### Newsletter Page Overhaul
- Editorial layout with Sophia video hero, archive sidebar, folder structure
- Dynamic newsletter from JSON with archive delete buttons
- Newsletter subscribe wired to Supabase with schema SQL
- Sophia weekly recap videos integrated (custom avatar v2, 80s theme)

### Other Features
- Smart countdown timer for market open/close (green/red colors)
- Scrolling ticker wired to live financial news (Alpaca/Finnhub), tuned to comfortable speed with pause-on-hover
- Removed Grok AI tab from sidebar

## What We Fixed
- Vercel crypto compatibility — cycled through `require('crypto')` → ESM import → Web Crypto API for edge runtime
- Added `nodejs` runtime to key routes that need Node.js crypto
- Ticker scroll speed tuned (500s ultra-slow crawl)
- Newsletter button wired to actual page instead of old modal
- Bottom bar height + glassmorphism glow on Newsletter button
- Removed command palette from bottom bar

## Key Decisions
- **Production URL clarified:** `stratify.associates` (NOT stratify-eight.vercel.app — different project)
- **LiveAvatar over plain HeyGen API** — HeyGen API has 0 credits; LiveAvatar is the interactive product ($99/mo)
- **Female avatars going forward** — Jeff's preference for future video content
- **Planned:** Weekly market recap videos auto-generated from market intel cron data
